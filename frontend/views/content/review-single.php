				TSB is basically a fan-game about Toad trying to save the mushroom kingdom from Bowser & Kamek,
				while Mario is out in distant lands. Toad has to save the mushroom kingdom by collecting the
				seven Starspheres (guarded by originally-made bosses) from the seven worlds so he can restore peace
				to the mushroom kingdom.
